# Getting Started with Create React App deployment

This project was based on building and deploying a simple web application using Jenkins and Docker.

## Tools used

1. I have used Docker to build, push and deploy the application.
2. I automate the entire process of building and deploying the application using Jenkins(CI/CD tool).
3. Used Git for version control and Github as SCM (Source Code Management).
